# Sales Analysis - Axiworks Solutions (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project showcases a **Sales analysis dashboard** built in Power BI for the fictional company **Axiworks Solutions**. 
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and reporting skills using fictional sales data.

## Key Features

- **Sales Metrics**:

  - Calculated **Net Sales**, **Gross Sales**, **Ordered and Sold Items**, **Return Percentage**.
  - Identified **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to provide actionable insights and highlight areas requiring attention.

- **Sales Overview**:

  - Sales performance by **product**, **region**, **customer segment**, and **time periods** (Quarter 1 and Quarter 2).
  - Visualized trends and comparisons to highlight key insights.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on fictional data provided in three datasets:

1. **Orders**: Contains details of all sales transactions.
2. **Returns**: Tracks returned items.
3. **Users**: Contains information about employees (not used in this report).

### Data Preparation

- Merged the **Orders** and **Returns** datasets to create a unified dataset.
- Calculated sales metrics and derived KPIs for reporting.
- Ensured data consistency and accuracy through transformations in Power BI.
